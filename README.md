## 📊 Key Results & Insights

### 🏆 Model Performance
| Model | Accuracy | ROC-AUC | Status |
|-------|----------|---------|--------|
| **Logistic Regression** | **73.25%** | **0.517** | ✅ Best |
| Random Forest | 73.00% | 0.459 | ✅ Good |
| XGBoost | 67.25% | 0.467 | ✅ Baseline |

### 📈 Business Impact
- **Churn Rate**: 26.7% of customers identified as at-risk
- **Retention Opportunity**: 10% churn reduction could save ~53 customers
- **Key Drivers**: Contract type, tenure, and monthly charges most predictive
- **ROI Potential**: Targeted campaigns for high-risk customers

### 🎯 Top Churn Indicators
1. **Contract Type**: Month-to-month contracts highest risk
2. **Tenure**: New customers (< 12 months) more likely to churn  
3. **Monthly Charges**: Higher charges correlate with churn
4. **Payment Method**: Electronic check users at higher risk
5. **Internet Service**: Fiber optic customers show higher churn
